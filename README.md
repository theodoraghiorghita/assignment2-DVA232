# Currency Converter App
**1. API**

   The app fetches the latest currencies and exchange rates from the fixer.io app.
   
**2. LOCATION** 

  The app requests for the user's location in order to set the base currency as the user's country they currently reside in. This can be changed by the user anytime if needed. The plugin used for this feature is GEOLOCATOR.

  The location will be updated whenever the user opens the app.
  
**3. PORTRAIT / LANDSCAPE**

   The app works in both portrait and landscape mode.
   
**4. OTHER FEATURES**

   The selection of the currencies is done by having a currency selector page where they can easily search currencies either by their name or by the country they want to find the currency for. This also works for the exchange rates page where the user can see all the rates for the selected base currency.
   
   There is also an easy invert button that allows the user to invert the base currency into the converted one.
